# OpenTelemetry Spring API Instrumentation Project

![OpenTelemetry Logo](https://opentelemetry.io/img/logo-colour.svg)

Welcome to the OpenTelemetry Spring API Instrumentation project! This project aims to explore the instrumentation of a Java API with Spring, utilizing the OpenTelemetry collector and agent to work their magic. All of this is set up within a complete Podman environment. As my primary distribution is Fedora, adjustments may be needed in the startup script [build_and_run.sh] for switching from Podman to Docker.

## Getting Started

To get started, simply run the provided script `build_and_run.sh`. This script sets up the environment and starts the services. You can then access the API endpoints through your browser at [http://localhost:4500/health](http://localhost:4500/health). Additionally, you can explore the metrics generated by accessing Zipkin at [http://localhost:9411](http://localhost:9411).

## Error Simulation

We've included another microservice named `serviceapi` that allows you to simulate 500 errors. This is useful for visualizing error metrics and observing Zipkin's behavior. Feel free to experiment with this feature in any way your imagination permits!

## Notes

- This project assumes a Fedora environment as the primary distribution. Adjustments may be needed for other distributions.
- For switching between Podman and Docker, refer to the provided script `build_and_run.sh`.
- Explore the metrics generated using Zipkin at [http://localhost:9411](http://localhost:9411).
- Feel free to experiment and adapt this project to suit your needs. The primary aim is to understand how modern applications behave in a production environment.

Happy exploring!
